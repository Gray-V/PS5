## Programming

1. **Pet Logic** – `pet_logic.py` (60 points)

   As you explore Python classes, it’s time to put it into action! In this assignment, you’ll build fill out a class that represents a pet. You’ll implement methods to feed, play with, and check the status of your pet. The class should include attributes for the pet’s name, type, age, and health. 

   You’ll create methods that will overide the default behavior of the class. For example, if you have a `Dog` class, you might want to override the `feed` method to include a special treat for dogs.

2. **Pygame** – `pygame_pet.py` (40 points)

   In this assignment, you’ll edit this file to improve the game working with your logic already made. There are no tests for this file, but you should be able to run the game and see your pet in action. Follow the instructions at the top of the file to get started. You’ll need to install Pygame if you haven’t already.
   You can do this by running `pip install pygame` in your terminal. Once you have Pygame installed, you can run the game by executing the file in your terminal.

### Unit Testing

There is only one test file for this assignment. You will need to run the test file that tests the functionality of your `pet_logic.py` file. Each test is worth 6 points!
